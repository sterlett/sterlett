// Svelte performs CSS optimization, which removes unused component styles from the output, to minify footprint of
// application assets. Compiler implementation (at least 3.24.*) also appends a specific "svelte-{hash}" class to the
// elements to restrict component-scoped styles to the current template part.
//
// Menu component depends on third-party Router and its sub part, Link. So, technically, they are different scopes,
// therefore we are forced here to declare all menu styles as global. Anyway, the link styles (a.active) will be
// stripped by the CSS optimization mentioned above and there is no convenient solution
// (see https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/4281#issuecomment-575676030) to tell Svelte about all modifiers,
// applicable to the template parts within child component at runtime.
