## Goals

**Sterlett** is a microservice and console API for retrieving and processing public information
about computer hardware prices. It may help to buy the most efficient microchips in your region
by the lowest price, using several benchmark providers and taking into account local currency spikes
and pricing fraud.

## Architecture

The microservice represents a set of backend and frontend containers behind a gateway
for routing and load balancing.

Backend: PHP 7.4+, [ReactPHP](https://github.com/reactphp/reactphp), 
[Symfony](https://github.com/symfony/symfony) 5 components. \
Frontend: [Lighttpd](https://lighttpd.net) 1.4, JavaScript (ES5, ES6+),
[Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) 3, [Spectre.css](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre). \
Gateway: [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.com) 2.2.
